Palin is evidently ''not'' a reliable source for determining who was \"the first writer to play with the conventions of television\". Therefore, that verbatim quote ''cannot'' be used to validate the gist of what is being said, the fact that Pain and Jones looked to Milligan as a model of innovation in television. It ''cannot'' be said that Milligan was \"the first\", because, though he may have been the first ''in Britain'',  he was not the first in the word, period.
